# This Website Is Generated From a Github Repository

A Github repository can store arbitrary files. Usually, they are used for storing code. This one, however, stores a PDF that can be printed, folded, laminated, and stapled into a new copy of Bespokonomics.

If you want to put your own bespoke spin on a printing of Bespokonomics, feel free! You can even create a pull request to upload your creation here, so other people can use your version.

# Future Possibilities

We can do whatever the f**k we want!

We could announce a new cryptocurrency right here!

We could coordinate the use of 3D printers/makerspaces!

We could organize a revolution that decentralizes the means of production!

Even the sky is not the limit!!!!!
